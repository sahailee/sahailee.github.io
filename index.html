                        <p>I am Sophomore at Stony Brook University
                        pursuing Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics. Besides computer science and math, I love basketball and music. I love all things basketball, watching, playing at the school's rec center, playing the videogame. I listen to all sorts of music across different genres and different languages, Afghan, American, Arabic, Indian, Iranian, and much more. My favorite quote of all time is "Just when you think you have all the answers, I change the questions" by Rowdy Roddy Piper just because that is the coolest sentence I have ever heard in my life. Anyways, this is my website where you can find out all about my past experiences and skills, enjoy!</p>

                                    <p>This project introduced me to the beautiful world of Computer Science. I came up with the idea to make this game during a calculus midterm. I learned some basic C# and how to use the Unity game engine. I made every asset for the project using Adobe Photoshop. My role in this project was the group leader. I assigned everyone what to do and took on the brunt of the project. I was driven by passion to get this game made and I'll always be proud of it.</p>

                                    <p>I was in charge of implementing the back-end and various features for the app. I worked with Firebase to handle the creation of in-app events and friends and implemented the features to create, load, and remove events, invite friends to the app, invite friends to an event, add and remove friends from the friends list and many more features. A big lesson from this project is the importance of debugging and documenting code as without it, the project could get extremely messy especially because of the multithreading.</p>

                                    <p>This project was my submission for the SBU 2019 hackathon. It is a small game made using Vue.js where a user is supposed to predict the price of bitcoin in the next 5 seconds. I worked with CryptoCompare API to get the current price of Bitcoin. With this project I dipped my toes in the water of React and VueJS. Currently, I have been working more with React, so be on the lookout for another project but using React.</p>
